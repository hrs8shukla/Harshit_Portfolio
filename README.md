This is my personal portfolio made with [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

And it is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which requires just a file `_redirects` with a single line:

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## Project setup

```bash
#install dependencies
npm install

# Compiles and hot-reloads for development
npm run serve

# Compiles and minifies for production

```
