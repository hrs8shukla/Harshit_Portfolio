This is my personal portfolio made with [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

And it is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which requires just a file `_redirects` with a single line:

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## Project setup

```bash
#install dependencies
yarn install

# Compiles and hot-reloads for development
yarn serve

# Compiles and minifies for production
yarn build

# Lints and fixes files
yarn lint
```

# Contact Form

EmailJS is being used to forward the entries from Contact form to email.
